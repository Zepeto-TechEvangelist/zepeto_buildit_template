## Vehicles

These objects will be provided with themes and available via the Buildit Asset Browser. They contain full integrated components:

- Player interaction
- Vehicle drive system
- Custom movement controls
- Multiplay synchronization

> `Note`: Using unique names for the vehicle objects ensures full multiplay capabilities. When testing your game you might get a warning to let you know which vehicle it is.
```Duplicate vehicle [vehicle_object_name], please use unique object names``` 


The vehicle objects are more complex and customization is recomended only for some parameters (see [Vehicle Settings](#vehicle-settings)).



## AdVehicleSpawner

The advertisement spawner creates a temporary vehicle as a reward for watching an advertisement.

* The vehicle remains available only while the player is driving
* When the player exits, the vehicle is automatically destroyed

**Configuration parameters:**

* **Vehicle Prefab**: The vehicle object to spawn.
  Select a prefab from: `BuilditTemplate/Prefabs/ZepetoAssets_Vehicle/`

* **Spawn Point**: Location where the vehicle appears.

* **Life Time**: Time in seconds before the vehicle is destroyed.
  If set to `0` or below, the timer is disabled and the vehicle remains until the player exits.

## Vehicle Vendor

The vehicle vendor lets players select and spawn a vehicle through an interactive booth.
It is made up of two parts:

1. An interaction model
2. A vehicle selection popup

**Basic customization structure:**

```
+ vehicle_vendor
    SpawnLocation
  + Booth
    + Trigger
      Icon
    + Model
      VE_Kiosk_001
```

* **SpawnLocation**: Where the vehicle is created
* **Icon**: Position of the interaction icon
* **Model**: The booth model. Replace or edit for a custom design

### Customizing the selection list

The popup contains a scrollable list of available vehicles

```
+ Popup
  + SafeArea
    + Container
      + Content
        + Horizontal
          + Item_1
          + Item_2
          ...
```

* To add a vehicle: duplicate an existing `Item_X`.
* To remove a vehicle: delete the corresponding `Item_X`.
* To modify a vehicle entry:

  1. Find the **UIContentItem** component and set the `Item` property to the desired vehicle prefab.
  2. Update the thumbnail by editing the child element `RawImage > Texture`.

They apply to all instances of that vehicle (e.g `Car_001`). All vehicle object settings are located in
`Themes/ZepetoAsset_Vehicle/Settings`

* **rotateAnglePerFrame**: Steering sensitivity.
* **accSpeedPerFrame**: Forward acceleration rate.
* **decreaseSpeedPerFrame**: Deceleration rate.
* **magnification**: Global speed multiplier.
